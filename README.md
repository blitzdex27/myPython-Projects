Projects I did using Python

Hello! I'm Dexter.

These repository contains my projects in Python so far. 

I am a beginner planning to shift my career into programming.

I would be very glad if you could recommend a better code than mine and provide your insights.

I made this public so I can learn from recommendations of other people while I am learning.

Thank you!
